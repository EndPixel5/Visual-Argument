My visual argument is a simple image of a deer leaving a dead tree to head towards one with foliage. Ccombined with text telling that deer are leaving behind only invasive species the image shows deer's affect on the local environment.
This piece is meant to make people quickly realize that the amount of deer in the Pittsburgh parks is a major negative. My big goal is to get people to act towards ways to deal with this overpopulation.
